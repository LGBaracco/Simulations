# Simulations
A collection of small dynamical models developed during undergraduate studies.

## Peppered_moths
An agent-based NetLogo simulation, demonstrating the impact of pollution on the moths' phenotype. Further details about this project and corresponding research can be found [here](https://github.com/LGBaracco/Simulations/blob/main/Peppered_moths/Pollution_as_an_evolutionary_trigger_in_peppered_moths.pdf)

## Python
contains agent-based models developed using Python and the [vi](https://pypi.org/project/vi/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) libraries. This is a collaborative project, the original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/VarunB-17/Swarm-Robitics-Simulation-AI) 

### Python/Aggregation
Simulates animal aggregation in a predefined spot.

### Python/Competition
Agent-based interpretation of the Lotka-Volterra model, in agent-based fashion.

### Python/Flocking
Displays flocking behavior without constant movement.

## Matlab/
Contains Matlab simulations, the library [L2](https://www.few.vu.nl/~jmn300/l2-matlab/) is necessary to run these models. 

### Matlab/loneliness_domain
Domain model describing the risk factors and consequences of one's feeling of loneliness

### Matlab/loneliness_analysis
A backward analysis model which detects loneliness from its symptoms

### Matlab/Bystander_effect
A support model for an artificial agent. The agent detects an emergency as well as non-response from bystanders and sends a message to intervene.
