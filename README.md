# Simulations
A collection of small dynamical models.

## Peppered_moths
An agent-based NetLogo simulation, demonstrating the impact of pollution on the moths' phenotype.

## Matlab/
Contains Matlab simulations, the library [L2](https://www.few.vu.nl/~jmn300/l2-matlab/) is necessary to run these models. 

### Matlab/loneliness_domain
Domain model describing the risk factors and consequences of one's feeling of loneliness

### Matlab/loneliness_analysis
A backward analysis model which detects loneliness from its symptoms

### Matlab/Bystander_effect
A support model for an artificial agent. The agent detects an emergency as well as non-response from bystanders and sends a message to intervene.
